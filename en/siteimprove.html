        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>Acting as an RPA Consultant, this international project came with the aim of starting an insertion in the process automation activity,
          in a renowned American/Danish company operating in the Software area, mainly seeking to optimize various Websites,
          called SiteImprove. Until then, the company did not have an RPA area to automate its processes, so it was exactly based on this issue.
          which was my main performance. Working directly with the company's Solutions Director, my role was to build the RPA area from scratch, where I was
          responsible for implementing templates, technical documentation, delivery flows, process output standards, leading development teams
          and implement new robots to begin the journey of saving hours and precision of activities in the company.

        <div class="objetivo animation-target">
          <h3>Knowledge about RPA</h3>
          <p>One of the objectives of this project for the client is to understand exactly how RPA technology behaves in a company,
            as well as the relationship that this same technology can provide with a multitude of processes and activities carried out on a daily basis.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="objetivo animation-target">
          <h3>Hours saving</h3>
          <p>Another objective is due to the interest of starting to save hours spent on massive and time-consuming activities, where this
            would allow the company to redirect its efforts to other business fronts, seeking to further increase its annual revenue.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="objetivo animation-target">
          <h3>Activity Accuracy</h3>
          <p>Finally, one of the visions that was externalized as a necessity is the fact of having some type of automation that could comment on the
            minimum possible errors during the execution of an activity, precisely because we are constantly dealing with data where this type
            error could even be fatal for a certain business area.

        <h2>Project impacts</h2>
        <p>Several deliveries were made, many of which were even linked to the Salesforce platform.
          The client was able to clearly visualize the insertion of these automations in their own business environment, as well as
          was constantly in contact and offering suggestions on what to automate, making the relationship and insertion of technology in the company even easier.
