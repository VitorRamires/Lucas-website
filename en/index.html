                team management for over 8 years, where I had the
                opportunity to lead fronts in different market sectors
                of work, from the engineering area to the
                technology. My goal is to always seek stability and
                balance for any and all partner companies that I
                act, making it possible to aim not only for a
                healthy financial position, but also excellent projections
                profitability, to bring the generation of
                new projects and initiatives that can bring savings
                financial, increased revenue and quality of service
                provided. In addition to this, always opt for a strategy that
                be able to motivate and engage the team even more, showing the
                value of each one within the project/company combined with the

                    strategies based on data and facts that occur on the day
                    the day of the project. Along with this, I provide 1-1 feedback and

                    achieve the objectives proposed by the company and the goals
                    expected by the customer. I develop goals, indicators and new

                    for the team, I effectively seek recognition

                    I acted as a consultant on the project, which was aimed at
                    automation of SiteImprove's internal processes. At the time
                    Upon my arrival, the client did not have an automation area
                    of processes. So my initial role was to build this
                    area from scratch, causing it to begin its
                    life cycle with diverse development patterns,
                    documentation that identified each robot
                    development, demonstrate a healthy delivery flow
                    and cohesive to the customer, supporting the search for new processes
                    for automation, among many other fronts. O
                    The result of this was excellent, because in less than a year
                    more than 25 robots were placed in a production environment,
                    saving thousands of hours of work from various
                    customer's own associates. Along with this, I had
                    constant contact with the account manager to report the
                    progress of the project and possible ways of expanding
                    automation team, always aiming to maintain the quality of the
                    service provided.

                    there was a lot of maturity and, as it is a work that has already
                    was in operation a few years ago, the focus was to maintain
                    the quality of the service already provided to the customer, as well as
                    how to study ways to further scale the amount of
