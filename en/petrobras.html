        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>Acting as Project Manager, this national project, called COE RPA Petrobras, came with the aim of seeking significant time savings,
          added to the maintenance of excellence in the activities carried out by one of the largest companies in Latin America, focused on oil extraction
          and direct action in the Pre-Salt, called Petrobras. Utilizing process automation (RPA) technology to save massive man hours
          of petrobrás employees, the intention was to immerse themselves in a multitude of processes, from different areas, always seeking to identify points
          improvement and process automation opportunities. Working together with different business areas, it has been possible to carry out automation with more
          of 100 robots in the production area, bringing even more freedom so that Petrobras can redirect human efforts to other fronts that today
          could be considered company bottlenecks. As it was a contract worth just over R$40,000,000.00, several professionals were put into action under my supervision.
          management so that it would be possible to deliver qualitatively and efficiently to the customer.</p>

          <h3>Hours Savings</h3>
          <p>The primary objective of this project is directly related to achieving maximum savings in hours,
            by activity, at Petrobras. Any and all activities where process automation was included did not reflect
            only in terms of saving hours, but mainly in terms of financial savings for the company.

          <h3>Digital transformation</h3>
          <p>Petrobras, precisely because of its expressiveness in Latin America, is constantly seeking to enter
            increasingly in the world of technology. Therefore, in possession of this goal, RPA came with the intention of not only assisting

        <h2>Project impacts</h2>
        <p>Carrying out numerous monthly deliveries, the project has been successful in achieving its proposed objectives,
          where, including in one of the initiatives proposed by Petrobras to automate its Tax area,
          we delivered 8 robots which saved something close to 120M reais, even becoming a case
          of the company Automation Anywhere (owner of the automation platform) for the immense impact that these
          deliveries, taking into account that the robots were delivered in their entirety in just over 2 months.
